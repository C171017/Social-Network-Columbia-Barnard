Volunteer in Social Experiment! 🫵

*(Hi hi! This is the third version trial dedicated to students in the class. If you think this is interesting, join to process the data and discuss together! And Prof.... agreed this to be our final project if we all write our own separate papers. Also, one question: should the email to ask people copy and paste all or is it better to just forward? I’m just afraid for the latter situation that people would not expand to see the original email, but for the opposite, people may be less willing to forward this if it takes extra steps to copy and paste.)*

It’s said that, on average, 6 people connect you to anyone in the world! but what about within Columbia/Barnard? 🤔

To test this, students in SOCI1000UN: The Social World, challenge you to reach a target participant through our social network. 🕸️

Target Participant Info 🕵️‍♀️

	•	School & Year: CC 2026
	•	Major: Human Rights, Comparative Literature & Society
	•	Languages: French, English, Spanish, Mandarin (in order of frequency)
	•	Name: ...

What to do 📋

	•	If you know the person directly, forward this email to them.
	•	Otherwise, COPY AND PASTE this email, then forward it to anyone (≥1) who you believe is closer to the person based on the provided info.
	•	For data analysis, please fill out this Google Form.

Join in, PLEASE! 🥺 Isn’t it fun to see people you pass by on campus are actually so closely connected to you!

Conversion rate:

Changes: website updated

Feedback:
	1.	People didn't notice the email.
	2.	Could be perceived as stalking since it doesn’t explicitly state that the target is a volunteer participant.
	3.	The email lacks clarity, making recipients think they received it by mistake.

Have you heard that, on average, just 6 people connect you to anyone in the world? This project tests that theory within Columbia/Barnard, inspired by the 1967 Small World Experiment.

How It Works

Forward this email to someone closer to the target participant based on the given info. 
Each person continues this until it reaches the target using as few intermediaries as possible. 
e.g. if target is CS major who speaks Spanish, send it to someone in CS class who learned Spanish

What to Do 📋
	•	If you know the target participant directly, forward this email to them
	•	If not, forward this to someone you believe is closer
	•	For data analysis, please fill out this Google Form
	•	Let the next person know through other means (previous trials showed emails often get ignored 😭)

Target Participant Info 

	•	School & Year: CC 2027
	•	Major: Poli Sci & Econ
	•	Languages: Spanish, English
	•	Name: Ruby

THANK YOU SO MUCH🥺
