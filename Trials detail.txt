Volunteer in Social Experiment! 🫵

*(Hi hi! This is the third version trial dedicated to students in the class. If you think this is interesting, join to process the data and discuss together! And Prof.... agreed this to be our final project if we all write our own separate papers. Also, one question: should the email to ask people copy and paste all or is it better to just forward? I’m just afraid for the latter situation that people would not expand to see the original email, but for the opposite, people may be less willing to forward this if it takes extra steps to copy and paste.)*

It’s said that, on average, 6 people connect you to anyone in the world! but what about within Columbia/Barnard? 🤔

To test this, students in SOCI1000UN: The Social World, challenge you to reach a target participant through our social network. 🕸️

	•	School & Year: CC 2026
	•	Major: Human Rights, Comparative Literature & Society
	•	Languages: French, English, Spanish, Mandarin (in order of frequency)

What to do 📋

	•	If you know the person directly, forward this email to them.
	•	Otherwise, COPY AND PASTE this email, then forward it to anyone (≥1) who you believe is closer to the person based on the provided info.
	•	For data analysis, please fill out this Google Form.

Changes: website updated

Feedback:
	1.	People didn't notice the email.

	3.	The email lacks clarity, making recipients think they received it by mistake.
